# Semanticki

This program is used for e-learning. It is writen in python and we used rdflib as library for graph data manipulation. At the start of the application, program will go to "http://www.ftn.uns.ac.rs/688425263/studijski-programi--akreditovano-01-01-2013----01-06-2019--" and scrape all of the available courses along with basic informations. After that is done you can add any class you want or to do some pre defined searches but also you can write your own script.
